/*
  common react / redux mistakes
  1. undefined components and action types due to bad import / export statements
  2. uncaught in promise - error instead promise
*/

/*
redux-saga - makes handling side effects (async calls) easier
it makes use of generators in the background

watcher saga - sees all dispatched actions. if action matches
what they are watching, they assign it to a worker saga

worker saga - process the async action
*/

/*
  function* watchGetProducts() {
    // when GET_ALL_PRODUCTS is dispatched, it calls getAllProducts worker
    yield takeEvery(actions.GET_ALL_PRODUCTS, getAllProducts);
  }

  function* getAllProducts() {
    // sends api call
    const products = yield call(api.getProducts);
    // put - dispatches another action with receiveProducts
    yield put(actions.receiveProducts(products));
  }

*/

/*
  function* watchCheckout() {
    while(true) {
      yield take(actions.CHECKOUT_REQUEST);
      yield call(checkout);
    }
  }

  function* checkout() {
    try {
      const cart = yield select(getCart);
      yield call(api.buyProducts, cart);
      yield put(actions.checkoutSuccess(cart));
    }catch (error) {
      yield put(actions.checkoutFailure(error));
    }
  }

*/

/*
  saga helpers
    takeEvery - takes every matching action and runs the instructed saga,
      can run concurrent tasks
    takeLatest - same as takeEvery but cancels previous saga task if its still running

  effect creators - returns objects. the saga middleware executes on the object during iteration process
    call - runs a function, if it returns a promise, it pauses the saga till promise is resolved
    put - dispatches actions

    fork -
    select -
    race -
    spawn -
    join -
    cancel -

*/

/*
  Advantages
    code looks synchronous
    easy to write tests
    sagas are composable
    action - creators are pure, meaning you only return objects (not functions like thunks)
    isolates side-effects to single area
